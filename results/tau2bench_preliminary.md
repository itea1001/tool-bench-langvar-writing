# tau2-bench Language Variation Results (Preliminary)

## Multilingual User Simulator Approach

For tau2-bench, we modified the user simulator to speak in the target language by adding language instructions to the system prompt.

## Initial Results (3 tasks each, retail domain)

| Language | Accuracy |
|----------|----------|
| English (en) | 66.7% |
| Spanish (es) | 33.3% |
| Chinese (zh) | 33.3% |
| Swahili (sw) | 100% |

**Note**: These are preliminary results with very small sample size. Swahili outperforming English is likely due to variance. More comprehensive experiments needed.
